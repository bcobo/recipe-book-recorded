...... in preparation


1. **Prepare the Fruits:**
   

2. **Mix the Fruits:**
   - In a large bowl, gently mix all the prepared fruits together.

3. **Add Citrus Juice:**
   - Squeeze the juice of one lime or lemon over the mixed fruits. This not
     only adds a refreshing zing but also helps prevent the fruits, especially
     the banana and apple, from browning.

4. **Garnish (Optional):**
   - If you're using fresh mint leaves for garnish, sprinkle them on top of the salad for a pop of color and a fresh aroma.

5. **Serve:**
   - Enjoy the fruit salad as is, or chill it in the refrigerator for about an hour before serving for a refreshing treat.
